It addresses advanced techniques in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on recent research papers, novel application areas and open questions in the aforementioned fields. Based on basic prior knowledge gained in other courses, this module specifically focuses on the state-of-the-art in machine learning by introducing recent publications from the leading international conferences on machine learning (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), computer vision (e.g. CVPR, ICCV, ECCV), or their application in fields like computer graphics, 3d reconstruction, robotics, navigation, medicine, or body-worn sensorics. After covering the theory of such works, a project phase will ask every student to implement and apply one of the discussed techniques on their own in one of the leading machine learning frameworks. The results of the project phase need to be presented to the class.

It addresses advanced techniques in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on recent research papers, novel application areas and open questions in the aforementioned fields. Based on basic prior knowledge gained in other courses, this module specifically focuses on the state-of-the-art in machine learning by introducing recent publications from the leading international conferences on machine learning (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), computer vision (e.g. CVPR, ICCV, ECCV), or their application in fields like computer graphics, 3d reconstruction, robotics, navigation, medicine, or body-worn sensorics. After covering the theory of such works, a project phase will ask every student to implement and apply one of the discussed techniques on their own in one of the leading machine learning frameworks. The results of the project phase need to be presented to the class. ",

These include post-Keynesianism, old and new institutionalism, Marxism, the Austrian School, ordoliberalism, feminist economics and social economics. In addition to the central basic concepts, the statements of the various schools on consumption, business, state, labour, financial and other markets, money, nature, distribution are dealt with and placed in the context of current economic policy problems. In the seminar Alternative Economics and Sustainability, the planetary ecosystem fundamentals of economic activity (entropy, resources, sinks, natural cycles) and the micro- and macroeconomic environmental policy instruments are presented. Furthermore, different radical visions and models of an ecologically sustainable economy will be discussed and reflected with regard to the question of whether a sufficient post-growth economy is required in addition to efficiency strategies.The terms coaching and mentoring are used as collective terms for different consulting methods and approaches. The term coach usually refers to an external consultant, while the term mentor is usually applied to an experienced, internal company manager who supports new employees in their career development. In contrast to classical consulting, coaching does not provide direct suggestions for solutions, but supports the development of own solutions. Coaching refers to structured counselling sessions on questions of everyday professional life, e.g. leadership, communication and cooperation. Thereby the Coach as a neutral, critical discussion partner and, depending on the goal, uses methods from the entire Spectrum of personnel and management development. The mentoring approach focuses more on the transfer of experience and knowledge and places the mentoring relationship between mentor and mentee at the forefront of the joint work. ",

The tension between the claim of welfare organisations to represent the interests of the weak vis-\u00e0-vis the state and at the same time to be publicly financed providers of social services is also examined. A dogma-historical framework of modern production management is established. Starting from the question of what technological and institutional advances have made the contemporary industrial model, the microeconomic production theory, in particular the Derivation of the cost function of a company. Then, the limits of this optimization approach are critically explored against the background of a changed reality. Building on this, supply chain management takes on the perspective of more comprehensive production systems. Supply chains are analysed on the basis of the transaction cost approach. The third stage of development is the adaptation of the supply chain approach to sustainability concerns.

They then analyse the functioning of selected (traditional and partly \"westernised\") legal systems of different legal circles and examine the connection between the respective legal system, the specific institutions and the development potential (in the sense of sustainable development). The students are able to contribute to the development of a practical general theory of legal reform advice. Students also have a feeling for the specific nature and particular efficiency of \"modern\", \"western\" legal law, but can also explore the special social conditions on which its functioning is based. This is followed by the question to what extent and under what circumstances \"western\" law is suitable as a model for non-European states.

Post-growth economics as an ecologically oriented, heterodox social science sub-discipline comprises four research areas, firstly, the theoretical and empirical foundations of different growth critiques, secondly, an analysis of demand and supply-side growth constraints, thirdly, the development of economic and social science discourses, and thirdly, the development of economic and social science discourses. Systems beyond growth and within ecological limits (post-growth economy). The latter are the result of a four-stage reductive transformation strategy based on a) sufficiency, b) subsistence, c) regional economics and d) an industrial model that has to be adapted in the sense of material zero-sum games. Fourth, this module describes and analyses concepts, strategies and transformation scenarios for the implementation of a post-growth economy. These range from microeconomic approaches to the social diffusion of patterns of provision and existence suitable for post-growth to macroeconomic control instruments. On the basis of this four-dimensional analysis grid, the seminar will discuss various individual positions critical to growth (Kohr, Mumford, Latouche, Illich, Schumacher, Geogescu-Roegen, Paech, Fromm, Hueting, Widmer, Miegel, Gorz, Seidl/Zarhnt, Daly, Sakar, Binswanger, Pallante, Trainer, Altvater, Heinberg, Jackson, Schor, Victor, Welzer etc.).) as well as implementation proposals - especially those that already have (initial) empirical relevance (ecovillages, repair cultures, transition towns, \"New Start Switzerland\" etc.) - are classified, analysed and critically reflected upon.
